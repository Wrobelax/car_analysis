https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/Data%20Files/Historical_Wildfires.csv

The project consists of data analysis, data modeling training and testing of used car prices by using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit Learn and Numpy Python libraries. 
All data was pushed and managed on Github via Git bash. The data did not require cleaning so this step was omitted.

_Folder "data":_
- "Historical_wildfires" : File with input data used for analysis.


_Folder "scripts":_
- "data_cleaning.py" : Python file used for data cleaning, basic exploration of data and generating 'dleaned_data.csv'.
